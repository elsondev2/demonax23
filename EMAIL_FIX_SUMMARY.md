# 📧 Email Fix Summary - Render Deployment

## The Problem You Had

```
❌ Failed to send email: Connection timeout
❌ Error details: {code: 'ETIMEDOUT', command: 'CONN'}
```

**Root Cause:** Render's free tier blocks outgoing SMTP connections on port 587, so Gmail SMTP doesn't work.

---

## The Solution

**Use Resend instead of Gmail SMTP** - it works perfectly on Render!

### What I Changed in Code:

1. **Updated `backend/src/lib/email.js`:**
   - Added Resend as primary email service
   - SMTP as fallback (for local development)
   - Better error handling and logging

2. **Updated `backend/src/lib/resend.js`:**
   - Better initialization handling
   - Graceful fallback if API key missing

3. **Updated `backend/test-email.js`:**
   - Tests both Resend and SMTP
   - Shows which provider is being used

## What You Need to Do NOW

### 1. Sign Up for Resend (2 minutes)
- Go to: https://resend.com
- Create free account
- Get API key (starts with `re_`)

### 2. Add to Render (2 minutes)
Go to Render dashboard → Your backend service → Environment

Add these 3 variables:
```
RESEND_API_KEY = re_your_actual_api_key
EMAIL_FROM = onboarding@resend.dev
EMAIL_FROM_NAME = de_monax
```

### 3. Deploy & Test (1 minute)
- Save changes (auto-redeploys)
- Test signup flow
- Check Render logs

---

## How It Works Now

### Email Sending Priority:

1. **Try Resend first** (if `RESEND_API_KEY` is set)
   - ✅ Works on Render
   - ✅ No SMTP ports needed
   - ✅ Better deliverability

2. **Fallback to SMTP** (if Resend fails)
   - For local development
   - Won't work on Render (port blocked)

### Render Logs - What to Look For:

**Success:**
```
✅ Resend email service initialized
✅ Resend client initialized with API key
📧 Attempting to send email to: user@example.com
📧 Using Resend email service...
✅ Email sent successfully via Resend: abc123
```

**Error (if API key missing):**
```
⚠️ Resend API key not found, email features may be limited
ℹ️ Resend not available, will use SMTP fallback
📧 Using SMTP email service...
❌ Failed to send email via SMTP: Connection timeout
```

---

## Testing Locally

Before deploying, test locally:

```bash
# Add to backend/.env
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_api_key
EMAIL_FROM=onboarding@resend.dev
EMAIL_FROM_NAME=de_monax

# Run test
node backend/test-email.js
```

Expected output:
```
🧪 Testing email configuration...
✅ Resend API key found
📧 Sending test email...
✅ Test email sent successfully
   Provider: resend
🎉 All tests passed!
```

---

## Resend Free Tier

Perfect for your app:
- ✅ **3,000 emails/month**
- ✅ **100 emails/day**
- ✅ All features included
- ✅ No credit card required
- ✅ Production-ready

---

## Using Your Own Domain (Optional)

Default: Emails come from `onboarding@resend.dev`

To use your own domain (e.g., `noreply@yourdomain.com`):

1. **In Resend dashboard:**
   - Add your domain
   - Add DNS records (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
   - Wait for verification

2. **Update Render environment variable:**
   ```
   EMAIL_FROM = noreply@yourdomain.com
   ```

---

## Troubleshooting

### ❌ Still getting timeout errors?
**Check:**
- Is `RESEND_API_KEY` added to Render?
- Did service redeploy after adding the key?
- Check Render logs for "Resend email service initialized"

### ❌ "Invalid API key" error?
**Check:**
- API key is correct (starts with `re_`)
- No extra spaces in the key
- Key has "Sending access" permission in Resend

### ❌ Emails not arriving?
**Check:**
- Spam folder
- Render logs for errors
- `EMAIL_FROM` is set correctly
- Try with `onboarding@resend.dev` first
