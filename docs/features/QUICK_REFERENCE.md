## Technical Details

### Socket Events
- `newFollower` - Triggered when someone follows you
- `followerRemoved` - Triggered when someone unfollows you

### Validation
- Cannot follow yourself
- Cannot follow the same user twice
- Must be authenticated to follow/unfollow

### Caching
- Follow leaderboard cached for 30 seconds
- Follow stats cached per user
- Admin dashboard uses intelligent caching

## Troubleshooting

### Follow button not working?
- Check if you're logged in
- Verify you're not trying to follow yourself
- Check browser console for errors

### Leaderboard not showing?
- Ensure you're logged in as admin
- Check if users have followers
- Try clicking refresh button

### Text inputs still side-by-side?
- Clear browser cache
- Check if viewing on desktop (mobile has different layout)
- Verify CSS classes are applied
