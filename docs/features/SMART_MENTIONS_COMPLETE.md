## How It Works

### Type `@` for Users
```
You type: "Hey @"
→ Dropdown appears instantly

You type: "Hey @jo"
→ Shows: John, Joseph, Joan (filtered)

You select: John
→ Text becomes: "Hey @John "
→ Dropdown closes
→ Cursor ready for more typing
```

### Type `#` for Groups
```
You type: "Check #"
→ Shows all groups/communities

You type: "Check #dev"
→ Shows: #dev-team, #developers

You select: #dev-team
→ Text becomes: "Check #dev-team "
```

### Special Mentions
```
In group chat, type: "@e"
→ Shows: @everyone, @emily, @eric
→ @everyone appears first (orange icon)

Select @everyone
→ Mentions all group members
```
