## 🔒 Security

### Protected Routes

All admin routes require:
1. ✅ Valid authentication token
2. ✅ Admin role verification
3. ✅ Active session

### Access Control

- **Non-authenticated users** → Redirected to `/admin/login`
- **Regular users** → Redirected to `/chat`
- **Admin users** → Full access to admin panel
