# üö® IMPORTANT - Resend Domain Verification Required

## Current Issue

Resend is working, but you're in **test mode**. You can only send emails to:
- ‚úÖ `elsonmgaya25@gmail.com` (your verified email)
- ‚ùå Other emails (blocked until domain verified)

Error message:
```
You can only send testing emails to your own email address (elsonmgaya25@gmail.com). 
To send emails to other recipients, please verify a domain.
```

---

## Solution: Verify a Domain

You have 2 options:

### Option 1: Use Resend's Test Domain (Quick - 2 minutes)

Resend provides a test domain for development. This is the fastest option:

1. **In Resend dashboard:**
   - Go to **Domains** section
   - Look for any pre-verified test domains
   - Copy the domain (e.g., `onboarding@resend.dev`)

2. **Update Render environment variable:**
   ```
   EMAIL_FROM = onboarding@resend.dev
   ```

3. **Save and redeploy**

This should work immediately for all recipients!

### Option 2: Verify Your Own Domain (Recommended - 30 minutes)

For production, use your own domain:

#### Step 1: Add Domain in Resend (5 minutes)

1. Go to Resend dashboard ‚Üí **Domains**
2. Click **"Add Domain"**
3. Enter your domain: `yourdomain.com`
4. Click **"Add"**

#### Step 2: Add DNS Records (10 minutes)

Resend will show you DNS records to add. You need to add these to your domain registrar (GoDaddy, Namecheap, Cloudflare, etc.):

**SPF Record:**
```
Type: TXT
Name: @
Value: v=spf1 include:_spf.resend.com ~all
```

**DKIM Records (3 records):**
```
Type: CNAME
Name: resend._domainkey
Value: [provided by Resend]

Type: CNAME
Name: resend2._domainkey
Value: [provided by Resend]

Type: CNAME
Name: resend3._domainkey
Value: [provided by Resend]
```

**DMARC Record:**
```
Type: TXT
Name: _dmarc
Value: v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:dmarc@yourdomain.com
```

#### Step 3: Wait for Verification (5-48 hours)

- DNS changes can take time to propagate
- Resend will automatically verify once DNS is updated
- You'll get an email when verified

#### Step 4: Update Render Environment Variable

```
EMAIL_FROM = noreply@yourdomain.com
```

## Quick Fix for NOW (Use Test Email)

While waiting for domain verification, you can test with your own email:

### In Render Dashboard:

Update this environment variable:
```
EMAIL_FROM = elsonmgaya25@gmail.com
```

This way, all verification emails will come from your verified email address, and Resend will allow sending to any recipient.

**Note:** This is just for testing. For production, verify a domain.

---

## Alternative: Keep Using SMTP (Not Recommended)

If you don't want to verify a domain, you can remove Resend and use only SMTP:

1. **Remove from Render:**
   - Delete `RESEND_API_KEY` environment variable

2. **The app will fallback to SMTP**
   - But SMTP is blocked on Render (timeout errors)
   - Won't work in production

**Not recommended** - Resend is much better!

---

## Recommended Approach

### For Testing (Right Now):

1. **Update Render environment variable:**
   ```
   EMAIL_FROM = elsonmgaya25@gmail.com
   ```

2. **Save and redeploy**

3. **Test signup** - should work for all recipients now!

### For Production (Later):

1. **Verify your domain in Resend**
2. **Update EMAIL_FROM to use your domain**
3. **Better deliverability and branding**

## Check if It's Working

After updating `EMAIL_FROM`, check Render logs:

‚úÖ **Success:**
```
üìß Using Resend email service...
‚úÖ Email sent successfully via Resend: abc123
```

‚ùå **Still failing:**
```
‚ùå Resend error: You can only send testing emails...
```

If still failing, make sure:
- `EMAIL_FROM` is set to `elsonmgaya25@gmail.com`
- Service has redeployed
- You're using the latest code

---

## Summary

**Quick Fix (2 minutes):**
1. Set `EMAIL_FROM = elsonmgaya25@gmail.com` in Render
2. Save and redeploy
3. Test signup - should work!

**Production Fix (30 minutes):**
1. Verify your domain in Resend
2. Update `EMAIL_FROM` to use your domain
3. Better for production use

## Need Help?

1. **Can't verify domain?** Use `elsonmgaya25@gmail.com` for now
2. **Still getting errors?** Check Render logs for details
3. **Want to use your domain?** Follow Option 2 above

---

üéØ **Action Required:** Update `EMAIL_FROM` in Render to `elsonmgaya25@gmail.com` and redeploy!
