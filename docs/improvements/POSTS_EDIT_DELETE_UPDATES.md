## Technical Details

### New State Variables:

const [editingPost, setEditingPost] = useState(null); // post object being edited
```

### New Functions:
```javascript
function startEditPost(post) // Opens modal in edit mode
async function updatePost() // Updates existing post
```

### Modified Functions:
```javascript
async function deletePost(id) // Removed confirm(), uses modal state
async function submitPost() // Works for both create and edit
```

### UI Changes:
- Modal title: "Create Trak" or "Edit Trak"
- Submit button: "Publish Trak" or "Update Trak"
- Added Edit button next to Delete
- Custom delete confirmation modal
