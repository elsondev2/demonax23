# Final Call System Improvements - Complete

## All Improvements Implemented ✅

**Location:** Customize Appearance → Sounds Tab

**Features:**
- Ringtone selection with 4 options
- Preview functionality (5 seconds per ringtone)

- Notification sound preview
- All settings in one place

**Sound Preview Improvements:**

### 2. Call Modals Follow DaisyUI Theming ✅
**Implementation:**

- Follows DaisyUI color system:
  - `bg-base-100` for backgrounds
  - `text-base-content` for text
  - `btn-primary`, `btn-success`, `btn-error` for buttons

**Modal Features:**

### 3. Call Cancellation on Both Sides ✅
**Implementation:**
- When caller cancels: Emits `call-end` event to receiver
- When receiver declines: Emits `call-reject` event to caller
- When either ends call: Emits `call-end` event to other party
- Both sides receive the event and close modals

**Backend Events:**
- `call-request`: Initiates call
- `call-answer`: Accepts call
- `call-reject`: Declines call
- `call-end`: Ends active call
- All events properly routed to target user

### 4. User Profile Modal Call Button ✅
**Features:**

- Only enabled when user is online
- Disabled when already in a call
- Starts voice call when clicked
- Closes modal when call starts

**Online/Offline Status:**
- Live status indicator (green dot = online, gray = offline)
- Pulsing animation for online status
- Updates in real-time using onlineUsers array
- Status shown in top-left of modal

### 5. Call Button Availability ✅
**Rules:**
- Button enabled: User is online AND not in a call
- Button disabled: User is offline OR already in a call
- Visual feedback: Grayed out when disabled
- Tooltip shows reason when disabled

### Audio Management System:

```javascript

const currentAudioRef = useRef(null);

// Stop all audio function
const stopAllAudio = () => {
  if (currentAudioRef.current) {
    currentAudioRef.current.pause();
    currentAudioRef.current.currentTime = 0;
    currentAudioRef.current = null;
  }
};

// Each preview function:
1. Calls stopAllAudio() first
2. Creates new audio
3. Assigns to currentAudioRef
4. Plays audio
5. Cleans up on end
```

### Call Event Flow:
