# Integration Complete Summary

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Apps Page Modals - Fixed Widths
**Files Modified**: `frontend/src/components/AppsView.jsx`

**Changes**:
- ✅ AppDetailModal: Added `max-w-md` class + proper header/content/actions structure
- ✅ How It Works Modal: Added `max-w-md` class + proper header/content/actions structure
- ✅ Request App Modal: Already had `max-w-md` (from previous fix)

**Result**: All modals are now narrower and properly structured

---

### 2. GroupDetailsModal - Integrated useGroupInfo
**File Modified**: `frontend/src/components/GroupDetailsModal.jsx`

**Changes**:
- ✅ Imported `useGroupInfo` hook
- ✅ Replaced complex member counting logic with hook
- ✅ Updated admin detection to use `groupInfo.isAdmin`
- ✅ Updated member status badges to use `getMemberStatus()`
- ✅ Simplified online status checks with `isUserOnline()`

**Before**:
```javascript
// 50+ lines of member counting logic
const getMemberObj = (m) => { ... };
const normalizedMembers = ...;
const activeMembers = ...;
const isAdmin = React.useMemo(() => { ... });
```

**After**:
```javascript
const groupInfo = useGroupInfo(group);
const { totalMembers, activeMembers, isAdmin, getMemberStatus, isUserOnline } = groupInfo;
```

### 3. ChatsList - Integrated useGroupInfo
**File Modified**: `frontend/src/components/ChatsList.jsx`

**Changes**:
- ✅ Imported `useGroupInfo` hook
- ✅ Created `GroupItem` component that uses the hook
- ✅ Created `CommunityGroupItem` component that uses the hook
- ✅ Replaced `getActiveMemberCount()` function with hook-based components
- ✅ Added online member count display

**Before**:
```javascript
const getActiveMemberCount = (group) => {
  // 15+ lines of logic
  return activeCount + 1;
};

<div>{getActiveMemberCount(group)} members</div>
```

**After**:
```javascript
const GroupItem = ({ group, onClick }) => {
  const groupInfo = useGroupInfo(group);
  return (
    <div>
      {groupInfo.totalMembers} members
      {groupInfo.onlineCount > 0 && ` • ${groupInfo.onlineCount} online`}
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Remaining Minor Issues

### ChatsList

- Can be cleaned up or used for future features
- Unused error variables in catch blocks (can use `catch {}` instead)
