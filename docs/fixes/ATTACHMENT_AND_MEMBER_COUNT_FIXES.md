# Attachment and Member Count Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Image Attachment Options ✅

**Problem**: No way to preview images in full screen or download them from messages.

**Solution**: Added hover/click menu with options for:
- Full Preview (opens in modal with zoom controls)
- Download (downloads image to device)

**Features**:
- Three-dot menu appears on hover (desktop) or tap (mobile)
- Works for both main message images and attachments
- Full-screen preview modal with zoom in/out controls
- Download functionality for all images
- Menu closes when clicking outside

### 2. Skeleton Loader for Images ✅

**Problem**: Images showed loading spinner which looked unprofessional.

**Solution**: Replaced loading spinner with skeleton loader that matches the image dimensions.

**Benefits**:
- More professional appearance
- Better perceived performance
- Consistent with modern UI patterns
- No layout shift when image loads

### 3. Download Options for All Attachments ✅

**Problem**: Some attachments (PDFs, files) didn't have clear download options.

**Solution**: Added download buttons/icons to all attachment types:
- PDFs: Download icon button next to "View" button
- Other files: Download button with icon
- All downloads use proper filename from attachment

### 4. Image Loading on Receiver's Side ✅

**Problem**: Images weren't loading properly for the receiver (other user).

**Solution**: 
- Fixed optimistic message handling to only show for sender
- Ensured images load with proper eager/lazy loading strategy
- Added skeleton loader for all users
- Proper error handling for failed image loads

### 5. Member Count Fix (Re-applied) ✅

**Problem**: Group member counts were not including the admin and current user.

**Solution**: Re-added the `getActiveMemberCount` function that:
- Counts all active (non-deleted) members
- Adds 1 for admin if admin is not already in members list
- Properly handles edge cases

## Technical Details

### Image Preview Modal Component

**File**: `frontend/src/components/ImagePreviewModal.jsx`

**Features**:
- Full-screen overlay with dark background
- Zoom in/out controls (0.5x to 3x)
- Download button
- Close button
- Zoom percentage indicator
- Click outside to close
- Smooth zoom transitions

**Controls**:
- Zoom In: Increases zoom by 25%
- Zoom Out: Decreases zoom by 25%
- Download: Fetches and downloads image
- Close: Closes the modal

### Message Item Improvements

**File**: `frontend/src/components/MessageItem.jsx`

**Changes**:
1. Added image menu state management
2. Added preview modal state
3. Replaced loading spinner with skeleton loader
4. Added three-dot menu for images
5. Added full preview and download options
6. Added proper click-outside handling
7. Fixed optimistic message image display

**Image Menu Options**:
```javascript
- Full Preview: Opens ImagePreviewModal
- Download: Downloads image with proper filename
```

**Skeleton Loader**:
```jsx
<div className="skeleton w-full max-w-sm h-64 rounded-lg"></div>
```

### Attachment Handling

**Image Attachments**:
- Skeleton loader while loading
- Three-dot menu on hover
- Full preview option
- Download option
- Proper filename handling

**PDF Attachments**:
- View button (opens in modal)
- Download button with icon
- Proper filename preservation

**Other File Attachments**:

### Member Count Logic

**Function**: `getActiveMemberCount(group)`

**Logic**:
1. Normalize all members (handle strings, objects, deleted users)
2. Count active (non-deleted) members
3. Check if admin is in members list
4. If admin not in list, add 1 to count
5. Return total count

**Edge Cases Handled**:
- Deleted users (excluded from count)
- Admin as string ID or object
- Members as string IDs or objects
- Missing member data
