# Email Verification Changes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Emails Not Sending in Production
**Problem:** SMTP environment variables were missing from production configuration.

**Solution:**
- Added SMTP credentials to `.env.production`
- Enhanced email error logging in `email.js`
- Added validation for required SMTP credentials
- Added connection timeout settings for better reliability

### 2. ✅ Google OAuth Users Need Email Verification
**Problem:** Google OAuth users were auto-verified without email confirmation.

**Solution:**
- Changed Google OAuth signup to set `isVerified: false`
- Verification email now sent to Google OAuth users
- Existing unverified users redirected to verification flow
- Verified users can log in normally

## Files Modified

### `backend/src/controllers/auth.controller.js`
- Google OAuth new users: `isVerified: false` + send verification email
- Google OAuth existing users: Check verification status before login
- Removed auto-verification for Google OAuth users

### `backend/src/lib/email.js`
- Added SMTP credential validation
- Enhanced error logging with detailed error info
- Added connection timeout settings (10 seconds)
- Better console logging for debugging

### `backend/.env.production`
- Added SMTP configuration (host, port, user, password)
- Added email sender information
- Added CLIENT_URL for frontend links

### `backend/src/lib/env.js`
- Added `EMAIL_FROM` to environment config
- Added `RESEND_API_KEY` for alternative email service

## Testing Locally

Run the test script to verify email configuration:

```bash
node backend/test-email.js
```

This will:
1. Verify SMTP configuration is valid
2. Send a test email to your configured email address

## Deployment Checklist

### Before Deploying:

- [ ] Update `CLIENT_URL` in `.env.production` with your actual frontend URL
- [ ] Verify Gmail App Password is correct (16 characters, no spaces)
- [ ] Test email locally with `node backend/test-email.js`

### In Vercel Dashboard:

- [ ] Add all SMTP environment variables
- [ ] Add EMAIL_FROM and EMAIL_FROM_NAME
- [ ] Add CLIENT_URL with your frontend domain
- [ ] Deploy the updated code

### After Deploying:

- [ ] Test signup with regular email
- [ ] Test signup with Google OAuth
- [ ] Check Vercel function logs for email status
- [ ] Verify emails arrive (check spam folder)

## User Flow Changes

### Regular Email Signup:
1. User signs up with email/password
2. Account created with `isVerified: false`
3. Verification email sent automatically
4. User enters 6-digit code
5. Account verified, user logged in

### Google OAuth Signup (NEW):
1. User signs up with Google
2. Account created with `isVerified: false`
3. Verification email sent automatically
4. User enters 6-digit code
5. Account verified, user logged in

### Google OAuth Login (Existing Users):
1. User logs in with Google
2. If verified: Login successful
3. If not verified: Redirected to verification page

## Environment Variables Required

```env
# SMTP Configuration
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your-app-password

# Email Settings
EMAIL_FROM=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_FROM_NAME=de_monax

# Frontend URL
CLIENT_URL=https://your-frontend.vercel.app

# Optional: Resend (more reliable for production)
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_api_key
```

## Troubleshooting

### Emails not sending:
1. Check Vercel logs: `vercel logs <deployment-url>`
2. Look for `❌ Failed to send email` messages
3. Verify SMTP credentials are correct
4. Check Gmail security alerts for blocked sign-ins

### Gmail blocking:
- Use App Password (not regular password)
- Enable 2FA on Gmail account
- Generate new App Password from Google Account settings

### Better Alternative:
Consider using **Resend** for production:
- More reliable than Gmail SMTP
- Better deliverability
- Easier setup
- Sign up at https://resend.com

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Vercel** with updated environment variables
2. **Test both signup flows** (email + Google OAuth)
3. **Monitor logs** for any email errors
4. **Consider Resend** for better email reliability
5. **Update CLIENT_URL** in production env vars

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Run `node backend/test-email.js` locally first
2. Check Vercel function logs for errors
3. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
4. Test with a different email provider if Gmail fails
