# DM Edit Feature - Live Update Fix

## The Problem

When User A edited a message sent to User B, User B didn't see the edit in real-time.

### Why It Failed

**Scenario:**
- User A sends message to User B
- Message has: `senderId: A`, `receiverId: B`
- User A is viewing conversation with B → `currentConversationId = B`
- User B is viewing conversation with A → `currentConversationId = A`

**Old Logic (BROKEN):**
```javascript
// Tried to match conversation by receiverId only
const messageConversationId = updatedMessage.receiverId || updatedMessage.senderId;
const isRelevantConversation = (currentConversationId === messageConversationId);
```

**What Happened:**
- For User A (sender): `messageConversationId = B` matches `currentConversationId = B` ✅
- For User B (receiver): `messageConversationId = B` does NOT match `currentConversationId = A` ❌

User B never saw the update because the conversation IDs didn't match!

## The Fix

**New Logic (FIXED):**
```javascript
// For DMs, find the "other user" in the conversation
const senderId = updatedMessage.senderId;
const receiverId = updatedMessage.receiverId;

// If I'm the sender, I'm chatting with the receiver
// If I'm the receiver, I'm chatting with the sender
const otherUserId = (senderId === authUser._id) ? receiverId : senderId;

// Check if this "other user" is who I'm currently chatting with
const isRelevantConversation = (currentConversationId === otherUserId);
```

**What Happens Now:**
- For User A (sender): 
  - `otherUserId = B` (because A is the sender)
  - `currentConversationId = B` ✅ MATCH!
  
- For User B (receiver):
  - `otherUserId = A` (because B is the receiver)
  - `currentConversationId = A` ✅ MATCH!

Both users now see the update in real-time!

## Visual Flow

### Before Fix
```
User A edits message
    ↓
Backend emits "messageUpdated" to both A and B
    ↓
User A receives → ✅ Shows update (conversation matched)
User B receives → ❌ Ignores update (conversation didn't match)
```

### After Fix
```
User A edits message
    ↓
Backend emits "messageUpdated" to both A and B
    ↓
User A receives → ✅ Shows update (correctly identifies B as conversation partner)
User B receives → ✅ Shows update (correctly identifies A as conversation partner)
```

## Testing

### Test Case 1: User A edits their message
1. User A sends "Hello" to User B
2. User A edits to "Hello World"
3. **Expected**: Both A and B see "Hello World" immediately

### Test Case 2: Multiple edits
1. User A sends "Test" to User B
2. User A edits to "Test 1"
3. User A edits to "Test 2"
4. **Expected**: Both users see all edits in real-time

### Test Case 3: Edit while other user is offline
1. User A sends "Message" to User B
2. User B goes offline
3. User A edits to "Updated Message"
4. User B comes back online
5. **Expected**: User B sees "Updated Message" (not the original)

## Code Changes

**File**: `frontend/src/store/useChatStore.js`

**Function**: `socket.on("messageUpdated", ...)`

**Key Change**: Improved conversation matching logic for DMs to correctly identify the conversation partner from both sender and receiver perspectives.
