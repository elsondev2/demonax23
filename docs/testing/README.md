This directory contains testing guides, procedures, and development documentation for the V8 Chat Application.

## ðŸ“‹ Available Documentation

### ðŸ§ª Testing Guides
- **[Call Testing Guide](./CALL_TESTING_GUIDE.md)** - Comprehensive testing procedures for the call system
- **[Testing Guide](./TESTING_GUIDE.md)** - General testing documentation and procedures

## ðŸ§ª Testing Overview

### Testing Strategy
The V8 Chat Application uses a comprehensive testing approach:

- **Manual Testing**: Step-by-step testing procedures for critical features
- **Integration Testing**: Testing of component interactions
- **User Experience Testing**: Real-world usage scenario testing
- **Regression Testing**: Ensuring fixes don't break existing functionality

### Testing Categories
1. **Call System Testing** - Voice/video calling functionality
2. **Real-time Features** - Socket.IO and messaging systems
3. **Authentication** - Login, registration, and OAuth flows
4. **Group Management** - Group creation and member management
5. **UI/UX Testing** - Theme switching and responsive design

## ðŸ“ž Call System Testing

### Testing Procedures
The call system requires specific testing procedures:

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Two separate browser windows/sessions
   - Both users logged in with different accounts
   - Backend server running and connected

2. **Connection Testing**
   - Verify Socket.IO connections are established
   - Check console logs for initialization messages
   - Confirm WebRTC permissions are granted

3. **Call Initiation Testing**
   - Test call button functionality
   - Verify modal appearance and behavior
   - Check call request transmission

4. **Call Reception Testing**
   - Test incoming call detection
   - Verify modal display for receiving user
   - Check call acceptance/rejection

### Debug Information
During testing, check for these console messages:
```
ðŸ”Œ Socket connected, initializing systems...
ðŸ”§ Setting up call socket listeners...
ðŸ”§ Call system initialized successfully
ðŸ“ž handleIncomingCall called with data: {...}
```

## ðŸ”§ Development Guidelines

### Code Quality
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Add proper error handling and logging
- Include comments for complex functionality
- Test changes thoroughly before committing

### Debugging Process
1. **Reproduce the Issue**: Follow testing guides to reproduce problems
2. **Check Console Logs**: Look for error messages and debug information
3. **Review Documentation**: Check fixes and improvements for known solutions
4. **Apply Fixes**: Use documented solutions or develop new ones
5. **Verify Resolution**: Ensure the fix works and doesn't break other features

### Common Debug Scenarios
- **Call System Issues**: See **[Call Testing Guide](./CALL_TESTING_GUIDE.md)**
- **Theme Problems**: Check restart instructions in fixes documentation
- **Socket Connection Issues**: Review Socket.IO fixes documentation
- **Authentication Problems**: See authentication fixes in fixes directory
